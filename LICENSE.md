# OCP Closed Alpha Agreement

This Closed Alpha Agreement ("**Agreement**") is a contract between you and Omni Creator Products Corporation ("**OCP**" or "**we**" or "**us**") for you to use this software (the "**Software**") and any products and services of OCP that are accessed through the Software or your other related interactions with OCP ("**Services**"). The Software and Services are sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "**Game**."

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT TERMS THAT AFFECT YOU AND YOUR USE OF THE GAME, INCLUDING UGC AND FEEDBACK (BOTH AS DEFINED BELOW). BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE GAME.

YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE (OR THE AGE OF LEGAL MAJORITY UNDER APPLICABLE LAW), OR, IF NOT, THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED THIS AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND THAT HE OR SHE HAS AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.

## Confidentiality 

You are being given access to the Game in a closed alpha test that is not open to the public and is intended to be confidential. The Game, this alpha test, and all related information are strictly confidential. Unless expressly permitted by OCP in writing, you may not let anyone view or otherwise use the Game, or disclose to anyone any information about the Game, this Agreement and testing program, any UGC or Feedback, or any other confidential information of OCP that you learn. Without express written permission from OCP, sharing screenshots, gameplay or commentary about the Game is strictly prohibited, even after the test is over. Your obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information will not apply to information that (a) was known to you before receiving such information without an obligation of confidentiality, or (b) is received by you from a third party who was legally entitled to make an unrestricted disclosure.

## License Grant to You

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to install and use the Software in binary executable form only, and to access and use the Services through that copy of the Software, solely for your personal testing and evaluation of the Game. The Services include any UGC of other users that is made available to you through the Services. Any OCP software that updates, supplements or replaces the original Software is governed by this Agreement unless separate license terms accompany such update, supplement or replacement, in which case such separate terms will govern in the event of a conflict with this Agreement or as otherwise provided in such separate terms.

## License Limitations

The preceding states the entirety of your rights with respect to the Game. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you will not do, or authorize or permit any third party to do, any of the following: (a) distribute, license or sell the Game; (b) use the Game for any purpose other than your own personal, noncommercial use to test and evaluate the Game; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to discover the source code for the Game, or otherwise attempt to defeat any technical copyright protections in the Game; (d) modify, alter or create any derivative works of the Game (except for creating UGC with the tools and functionality made available in the Game for such purposes); or (e) remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice on or in the Game.

## Updates and Support

We may provide updates to the Software, including upgrades, bug fixes, patches, other error corrections, and/or new features ("**Updates**"). For the avoidance of doubt, Software includes all Updates. Continued use of the Game may require installation of Updates. However, we have no obligation to provide updates.

We may provide general support for the Game through various mediums, such as email or OCP-affiliated Discord servers. We have no obligation to provide support and, should we elect to provide support, we have no obligation to continue providing support.

## Ownership and User-Generated Content

The Game may enable users to create, modify, or customize code, scripts, in-game digital items and environments, gameplay elements, text, chat posts, usernames, and other materials ("**UGC**") and to operate and share their UGC for others to see, hear, use, interact with and experience through the Services.

Subject to the rights that OCP and its licensors have in the Game (including third-party UGC) and subject to the rights you grant to OCP in this Agreement, as between OCP and you, you are the owner of UGC that you create and you retain whatever rights you may have in your UGC.

The Game is the valuable property of OCP and its licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. We and our licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Game, including all copyright and other intellectual property rights.

You grant OCP a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual (including after the term of this Agreement), sublicensable (through multiple levels), worldwide right and license to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and display, disclose, implement and otherwise use your UGC in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation developing, distributing, marketing and selling the Game and other products and services incorporating such UGC. We will have no obligation to maintain or preserve any UGC. Your UGC may be changed or deleted at any time without notice or liability.

## Evaluation and Feedback

You agree to provide to OCP with comments, suggestions, questions, and other feedback regarding the performance, features, functionality, gameplay or other aspects of the Game ("**Feedback**") and will make yourself available to OCP on a reasonable basis for this purpose. You will not provide any such Feedback to any third party without OCP's prior written consent in each instance.

You hereby grant to OCP a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual (including after the term of this Agreement), sublicensable (through multiple levels), worldwide right and license to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and display, disclose, implement and otherwise use any such Feedback in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation developing, distributing, marketing and selling the Game and other products and services incorporating such Feedback.

We will have no obligation to consider, use, return, destroy or preserve any Feedback you provide to us. Any Feedback you provide to us may or may not be treated confidentially by us, and we will have no obligation or liability to you for the use or disclosure of any Feedback. You should not expect any compensation of any kind from us with respect to your Feedback.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless OCP and its affiliates, suppliers and representatives, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents ("**OCP Parties**"), from and against all claims, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to (i) your use of, or inability to use, the Game; (ii) your UGC; (iii) your violation of this Agreement; or (iv) your violation of any applicable law or regulation.

## Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

OCP WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND FOR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF UGC OR OTHER DATA. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

THE OCP PARTIES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY YOU ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSS OF DATA (INCLUDING UGC), EVEN IF A OCP PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE OCP PARTIES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME EXCEED ONE DOLLAR (USD 1.00). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES, SO THE FOREGOING WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

OCP may suspend your ability to access or use the Game at any time without notice. OCP may also terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, or may discontinue the Game at any time, in which case this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice.
